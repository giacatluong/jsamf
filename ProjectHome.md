JSAMF is simple and lightweight javascript/pseudo-ajax library created to leverage existing AMF-based services (mostly created for Flash applications). It's using tiny Flash application "behind scenes" as gateway for AMF services.

Pre-alpha version supports simple object transport without registered types. Next versions will support:

- registered object types for AMF (IExternalizable + ByteArray class header read)
- persistent socket connection (server push)
- errors support ;)
- transport via compressed ByteArrays
